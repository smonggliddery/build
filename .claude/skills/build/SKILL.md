You are orchestrating a structured build workflow. You act like Claude Code itself - use agents for parallel work, use tasks for tracking, be autonomous but structured. **You drive the entire workflow from start to finish without stopping to ask the user to switch sessions or models.** Use agents with model overrides to run phases that need a different model.

## First: Read State

Look in `.build/plans/` for any `*-state.md` file. If one exists, read it to determine the current phase and the workflow slug (the filename prefix, e.g. `holding-page` from `holding-page-state.md`).

If no state file exists, this is a fresh workflow - generate a short slug from $ARGUMENTS (e.g. "holding-page", "auth-refactor", "api-v2") and start at Phase 1. All files for this workflow use the slug as a prefix:
- `{slug}-state.md` - workflow state
- `{slug}-plan.md` - implementation plan
- `{slug}-review.md` - review notes

Also read the plan and review files if they exist - these carry context from previous phases.

Create the `.build/plans/` directory if it doesn't exist.

---

## Phase 1: Plan

**Trigger**: No state file, or state says `phase: plan`

1. **Parallel codebase exploration**: Deploy multiple Explore agents simultaneously to understand the codebase. Split by concern area, e.g.:
   - Agent 1: Architecture, project structure, build system, existing patterns
   - Agent 2: The specific area(s) of code relevant to $ARGUMENTS
   - Agent 3: Existing tests, test patterns, CI configuration
   - Add more agents if the task spans multiple domains (frontend/backend, multiple services, etc.)
   Wait for all agents to return before proceeding.
2. Invoke `/build:impl-plan` via the Skill tool for: $ARGUMENTS
3. The plan MUST include:
   - **Parallel Workstreams**: Identify which implementation steps are independent and can be assigned to separate agents during Phase 3. Group related work into named workstreams.
   - **Test Strategy**: What tests to write at each step, framework/tooling, manual vs automated.
   - **Dependencies**: Which workstreams must complete before others can start.
4. Save the plan to `.build/plans/{slug}-plan.md`
5. Write `.build/plans/{slug}-state.md`:

```
slug: {slug}
phase: review
task: [one-line description]
started: [YYYY-MM-DD]
last_updated: [YYYY-MM-DD]
complexity: [simple|complex]
workstreams: [list of named parallel workstreams from the plan]
history:
  - [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] Plan created
```

Set complexity to `complex` if the plan touches 5+ files or has multiple independent workstreams.

6. **Auto-continue**: Spawn a **Sonnet agent** to run Phase 2 (Review). Pass it the plan file path and instructions to review it. See [Auto-continue](#auto-continue-between-phases).

---

## Phase 2: Review (Sonnet agent)

**Trigger**: State says `phase: review`

1. Read `.build/plans/{slug}-plan.md`
2. Invoke `/build:review-plan` via the Skill tool
3. Save review to `.build/plans/{slug}-review.md`
4. Update state:
   - No critical issues: `phase: implement`
   - Critical issues: `phase: plan`, note what needs rework under a `rework_notes:` field
5. Append to history

**Return to caller**: whether review passed or needs rework, and a summary of findings.

After the Sonnet agent returns:
- **Passed**: Continue to Phase 3 (Implement) in the current session.
- **Rework**: Re-enter Phase 1 to revise the plan, addressing the rework notes.

---

## Phase 3: Implement

**Trigger**: State says `phase: implement`

1. Read the plan and review. If there are rework notes from a previous review, address those first.
2. Create tasks for each implementation step from the plan. Mark them as you go.
3. **Deploy agents per workstream**: Look at the plan's parallel workstreams and spin up agents simultaneously:
   - Each independent workstream gets its own agent running in an **isolated worktree** (`isolation: "worktree"`)
   - Give each agent a clear scope: which files to create/modify, which tests to write, and what "done" looks like
   - **Agent status reporting**: Include this in every agent dispatch prompt: "When finished, report your status as one of: DONE (all work complete, tests pass), DONE_WITH_CONCERNS (complete but flagging doubts), NEEDS_CONTEXT (missing information, cannot proceed), BLOCKED (cannot complete, explain why), SCOPE_CHANGE (the plan is wrong or incomplete - you discovered something that changes the approach. Describe what you found and why the plan can't proceed as written)."
   - Run agents for independent workstreams in parallel (single message, multiple Agent tool calls)
   - For workstreams with dependencies, wait for the dependency to complete before launching the dependent agent
   - **Model guidance**: Prefer sonnet for single-file mechanical tasks with clear specs. Prefer opus for multi-file integration, design judgment, or complex logic. This is guidance, not rigid - use judgment.
   - Use background agents for: running tests, linting, typechecking
4. **Handle agent statuses**:
   - **DONE**: Proceed. Merge the workstream's changes.
   - **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS**: Log the concerns. Continue, but surface them in mid-review or architect review.
   - **NEEDS_CONTEXT**: Provide the missing information and re-dispatch the agent.
   - **BLOCKED**: Escalate to the user immediately. Do not guess or work around it.
   - **SCOPE_CHANGE**: Halt all running agents for the affected workstreams. Log the discovery to the state file under `scope_changes:` with the agent's description of what was found. If the scope change affects other workstreams (shared assumptions, shared interfaces), halt those too. Update state to `phase: plan` with `rework_notes:` describing the scope change. Return to Phase 1 to revise the plan. Do not continue implementing against a known-broken plan.
5. **Test as you build** - every agent must write and pass tests for its workstream. Do not batch tests to the end.
6. **Merge and integrate**: After parallel agents return, integrate their work using this protocol:
   - Merge each worktree's changes sequentially, in dependency order from the plan (workstreams that others depend on merge first).
   - If a merge succeeds cleanly, continue to the next worktree.
   - If a merge produces conflicts:
     a. Log which files conflict and which workstreams produced them to the state file under `merge_conflicts:`.
     b. If conflicts are in non-overlapping sections of the same file, git's default merge handles them - accept the auto-resolution.
     c. If conflicts require judgment (overlapping changes to the same lines), spawn an Opus agent with both worktrees' diffs, the plan context for the affected workstreams, and instructions to resolve the conflict. The agent must explain its resolution choices in its response. If the resolution agent fails, escalate to the user rather than retrying - merge conflicts requiring human judgment are a reasonable escalation point.
     d. After all merges complete, run the full test suite to verify the integrated code works. If tests fail, treat as a verification failure (return to implement phase for the affected area).
7. **For complex changes** (state says `complexity: complex`):
   - After completing each major workstream, spawn a **Sonnet agent** for mid-review (Phase 3b)
   - Pass it the plan, review, and state file paths plus a summary of what's done/remaining
   - When the agent returns, address any fixes needed and continue implementing
8. Commit working chunks with clear messages as you go.
9. When all implementation is done and tests pass:
   - Update state to `phase: verify`
   - Append to history
   - **Auto-continue**: Proceed to Phase 3c (Verify).

---

## Phase 3b: Mid-Review (Sonnet agent)

**Trigger**: State says `phase: mid-review`, or spawned inline during Phase 3

1. Read the plan, review, and state (which notes what's done/remaining)
2. Review changes made so far against the plan
3. Run tests, check for issues
4. Update state:
   - Good: `phase: implement`, note what's done and what's remaining
   - Issues: `phase: implement`, add `fixes_needed:` field
5. Append to history

**Return to caller**: whether progress looks good or issues need fixing, with specifics.

---

## Phase 3c: Verify

**Trigger**: State says `phase: verify`

1. Invoke `/build:verify` via the Skill tool
2. If **VERIFIED**: Update state to `phase: architect-review`. Auto-continue to Phase 4.
3. If **FAILED**: Update state back to `phase: implement` with `verification_failures:` field listing what failed. Address failures and re-verify.
4. If **PARTIAL** (some checks unavailable): Note what's unavailable. Proceed to Phase 4 - missing check categories are not blockers, but the architect reviewer should know.
5. Save the verification report to `.build/plans/{slug}-verify.md`
6. Append to history

---

## Phase 4: Architect Review

**Trigger**: State says `phase: architect-review`

1. Read the full diff since the workflow started (use git log/diff against the base)
2. Read the original plan and review for intent
3. Read the verification report from Phase 3c
4. Invoke `/build:architect-review` via the Skill tool
5. Update state:
   - **PASS** or **PASS_WITH_NOTES**: `phase: complete`
   - **FAIL**: `phase: implement`, add `architect_fixes:` field with specific issues
6. Append to history

After the agent returns:
- **Passed**: Continue to Phase 5 (Complete).
- **Issues**: Re-enter Phase 3 to fix the architect's findings, then re-verify.

---

## Phase 5: Complete

**Trigger**: State says `phase: complete`

1. Summarise: what was built, what was tested, key decisions made
2. Archive: move the `{slug}-*.md` files to `.build/plans/archive/[date]-{slug}/`
3. If the project has noodle, save a session digest

**Say**: "Workflow complete. [summary]"

---

## Auto-continue between phases

When a phase completes and the next phase needs a different model, **spawn an Agent** rather than asking the user to switch sessions:

```
Agent(
  model: "sonnet",   // or "opus" for implementation phases
  prompt: "Read .build/plans/{slug}-state.md and run the current phase of /build. [context summary]"
)
```

- **Sonnet** for: Review (Phase 2), Mid-Review (Phase 3b)
- **Opus** for: Plan (Phase 1), Implement (Phase 3), fixes after review
- Pass the agent a summary of relevant context and file paths so it can work autonomously
- Wait for the agent result and continue the workflow based on its output

**Never stop and ask the user to start a new session.** The build loop drives itself.

---

## Circuit breakers

- **Agent retry limit**: If an agent for the same workstream fails and is re-dispatched more than 2 times, stop retrying and escalate to the user. Log all failure reasons to the state file under `agent_failures:`. The problem is likely in the plan or the codebase, not a transient failure.
- **Phase loop limit**: If the workflow cycles back to the same phase more than 3 times (e.g., implement -> verify -> fail -> implement -> verify -> fail -> implement), halt the workflow and escalate. Log the full cycle history. The problem is systemic.
- **Scope change limit**: If SCOPE_CHANGE is reported more than twice in a single workflow, halt and escalate. The original feature description is likely underspecified - re-planning won't help without more input from the user.

When any circuit breaker fires, update the state file with `halted: true`, `halt_reason: [which breaker]`, and `halt_context: [summary of failures/changes]`. The user can resume by updating the state file after addressing the root cause.

---

## Rules

- **Always read state first.** Never assume which phase you're in.
- **Always update state last.** The state file is the source of truth across sessions.
- **Never stop to ask the user to switch sessions.** Use agents with model overrides instead.
- **Never skip phases.** The review exists for a reason. The verify gate exists for a reason.
- **Tests are mandatory.** Every phase that writes code must write or update tests. If tests don't pass at the end of your phase, you're not done.
- **Verify before architect review.** Phase 3c is not optional. No verification evidence = no architect review.
- **Handle agent statuses explicitly.** DONE, DONE_WITH_CONCERNS, NEEDS_CONTEXT, BLOCKED, SCOPE_CHANGE. Don't ignore concerns or work around blocks.
- **Use agents aggressively.** Parallel exploration, parallel implementation of independent pieces, background test runs, and phase transitions. Work like Claude Code works.
- **Commit often.** Small, working commits > one big commit at the end.
- **Keep history honest.** Every phase transition gets a timestamped entry. Include what happened, not just "phase changed".
- **Respect circuit breakers.** Retry limits exist to prevent runaway agents burning tokens on a broken approach. When a limit is hit, escalate to the user with full context of what failed and why - don't work around it or increase the limit.
