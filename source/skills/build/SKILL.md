You are orchestrating a structured build workflow. You act like Claude Code itself - use agents for parallel work, use tasks for tracking, be autonomous but structured. **You drive the entire workflow from start to finish without stopping to ask the user to switch sessions or models.** Use agents with model overrides to run phases that need a different model.

## First: Read State

Look in `.build/plans/` for any `*-state.md` file. If one exists, read it to determine the current phase and the workflow slug (the filename prefix, e.g. `holding-page` from `holding-page-state.md`).

If no state file exists, this is a fresh workflow - generate a short slug from $ARGUMENTS (e.g. "holding-page", "auth-refactor", "api-v2") and start at Phase 1. All files for this workflow use the slug as a prefix:
- `{slug}-state.md` - workflow state
- `{slug}-context.md` - repo conventions, user constraints, discovered patterns, assumptions, out-of-scope notes
- `{slug}-requirements.md` - canonical requirements, decisions, assumptions, acceptance criteria, must_haves
- `{slug}-plan.md` - implementation plan
- `{slug}-review.md` - review notes
- `{slug}-implementation-summary.md` - completed waves, task IDs, files changed, deviations, blockers
- `{slug}-verify.md` - verification report
- `{slug}-architect-review.md` - architect review findings

Also read the artifacts required for the current phase - these carry context from previous phases. Always write the artifact the next phase needs before updating state to that phase.

Create the `.build/plans/` directory if it doesn't exist.

---

## Phase 1: Plan

**Trigger**: No state file, or state says `phase: plan`

1. **Parallel codebase exploration**: Deploy multiple Explore agents simultaneously to understand the codebase. Split by concern area, e.g.:
   - Agent 1: Architecture, project structure, build system, existing patterns
   - Agent 2: The specific area(s) of code relevant to $ARGUMENTS
   - Agent 3: Existing tests, test patterns, CI configuration
   - Add more agents if the task spans multiple domains (frontend/backend, multiple services, etc.)
   Wait for all agents to return before proceeding.
2. Invoke `/build:impl-plan` via the Skill tool for: [orchestrated] $ARGUMENTS
3. The plan MUST include:
   - **Requirements and Decisions**: `REQ-*`, `D-*`, and `A-*` inventories with acceptance criteria.
   - **Execution Manifest**: `execution_manifest` tasks with `id`, `wave`, `depends_on`, `files_modified`, `requirements`, `must_haves`, `verify`, and `done`.
   - **Wave 0 Validation Design**: tests, fixtures, commands, or manual evidence for each `REQ-*` before feature implementation.
   - **Workflow Artifacts**: which `{slug}-*.md` files each phase writes and reads.
   - **Parallel Workstreams**: Identify which implementation steps are independent and can be assigned to separate agents during Phase 3. Group related work into named workstreams.
   - **Test Strategy**: What tests to write at each step, framework/tooling, manual vs automated.
   - **Dependencies**: Which workstreams must complete before others can start.
4. Save the full plan to `.build/plans/{slug}-plan.md`.
5. Write `.build/plans/{slug}-context.md` with repo conventions, user constraints, discovered patterns, assumptions, and out-of-scope notes from the plan.
6. Write `.build/plans/{slug}-requirements.md` with canonical `REQ-*`, `D-*`, `A-*`, acceptance criteria, and `must_haves`.
7. Write `.build/plans/{slug}-state.md`. Capture `base_ref` by running `git rev-parse HEAD` before writing state:

```
slug: {slug}
base_ref: {full git SHA from git rev-parse HEAD}
phase: review
task: [one-line description]
started: [YYYY-MM-DD]
last_updated: [YYYY-MM-DD]
complexity: [simple|complex]
requirements: [REQ-* list]
decisions: [D-* list]
assumptions_confirmed: [A-* list with status inferred|confirmed]
workstreams: [list of named parallel workstreams from the plan]
execution_manifest: [summary of task IDs, waves, depends_on, files_modified]
completed_tasks: []
history:
  - [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] Plan created
```

Set complexity to `complex` if the plan touches 5+ files or has multiple independent workstreams.

8. **Auto-continue**: Spawn a **Sonnet agent** to run Phase 2 (Review). Pass it the slug and artifact paths for `{slug}-state.md`, `{slug}-context.md`, `{slug}-requirements.md`, and `{slug}-plan.md`, with instructions to run Phase 2 review from those files. See [Auto-continue](#auto-continue-between-phases).

---

## Phase 2: Review (Sonnet agent)

**Trigger**: State says `phase: review`

1. Read `.build/plans/{slug}-state.md`, `{slug}-context.md`, `{slug}-requirements.md`, and `{slug}-plan.md`
2. Invoke `/build:review-plan` via the Skill tool
3. Save review to `.build/plans/{slug}-review.md`
4. Update state:
   - No critical issues: `phase: implement`
   - Critical issues: `phase: plan`, note what needs rework under a `rework_notes:` field
5. Append to history

**Return to caller**: whether review passed or needs rework, and a summary of findings.

After the Sonnet agent returns:
- **Passed**: Continue to Phase 3 (Implement) in the current session.
- **Rework**: Re-enter Phase 1 to revise the plan, addressing the rework notes.

---

## Phase 3: Implement

**Trigger**: State says `phase: implement`

1. Read `.build/plans/{slug}-state.md`, `{slug}-requirements.md`, `{slug}-context.md`, `{slug}-plan.md`, and `{slug}-review.md`. If there are rework notes from a previous review, address those first.
2. Create tasks for each implementation step from the plan. Mark them as you go.
3. **Deploy agents per workstream**: Prefer the plan's `execution_manifest`. Route tasks by `wave`, `depends_on`, and `files_modified`. If the manifest is absent or malformed, report that and fall back to the prose implementation order and parallel workstreams:
   - Each independent workstream gets its own agent running in an **isolated worktree** (`isolation: "worktree"`)
   - Give each agent only its assigned task IDs, files, `must_haves`, verification commands, and what "done" looks like
   - **Spec compliance**: Each agent must verify its output against its assigned spec from the plan before reporting done. Include in every dispatch prompt: "Before reporting DONE, check your work against the plan's spec for this workstream. Every file, behavior, and test listed in your spec must be accounted for. If you built something the spec didn't ask for, or skipped something it did, report that."
   - **Agent status reporting**: Include this in every agent dispatch prompt: "When finished, report your status as one of: DONE (all work complete, tests pass, spec satisfied), DONE_WITH_CONCERNS (complete but flagging doubts), NEEDS_CONTEXT (missing information, cannot proceed), BLOCKED (cannot complete, explain why), SCOPE_CHANGE (the plan is wrong or incomplete - you discovered something that changes the approach. Describe what you found and why the plan can't proceed as written)."
   - Run agents for independent workstreams in parallel (single message, multiple Agent tool calls)
   - For workstreams with dependencies, wait for the dependency to complete before launching the dependent agent
   - On resume, skip task IDs already in `completed_tasks` unless `verification_failures`, `architect_fixes`, or `rework_notes` names those task IDs
   - `completed_tasks` is task-ID memory only. It does not detect post-completion file reverts or edits; if files are reverted, clear the affected task IDs from state or add `rework_notes` naming them before resuming.
   - **Model guidance**: Prefer sonnet for single-file mechanical tasks with clear specs. Prefer opus for multi-file integration, design judgment, or complex logic. This is guidance, not rigid - use judgment.
   - Use background agents for: running tests, linting, typechecking
4. **Handle agent statuses**:
   - **DONE**: Proceed. Merge the workstream's changes.
   - **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS**: Log the concerns. Continue, but surface them in mid-review or architect review.
   - **NEEDS_CONTEXT**: Provide the missing information and re-dispatch the agent.
   - **BLOCKED**: Escalate to the user immediately. Do not guess or work around it.
   - **SCOPE_CHANGE**: Halt all running agents for the affected workstreams. Log the discovery to the state file under `scope_changes:` with the agent's description of what was found. If the scope change affects other workstreams (shared assumptions, shared interfaces), halt those too. Update state to `phase: plan` with `rework_notes:` describing the scope change. Return to Phase 1 to revise the plan. Do not continue implementing against a known-broken plan.
5. **Test as you build** - every agent must write and pass tests for its workstream. Do not batch tests to the end. After each wave completes and its wave-level verification passes, write or update `.build/plans/{slug}-implementation-summary.md` with provisional wave results, files changed, verification commands run, deviations, blockers, and remaining task IDs. Do not append to `completed_tasks` until the wave's worktrees have been merged and integrated verification has passed.
6. **Merge and integrate**: After parallel agents return, integrate their work using this protocol:
   - Merge each worktree's changes sequentially, in dependency order from the plan (workstreams that others depend on merge first).
   - If a merge succeeds cleanly, continue to the next worktree.
   - If a merge produces conflicts:
     a. Log which files conflict and which workstreams produced them to the state file under `merge_conflicts:`.
     b. If conflicts are in non-overlapping sections of the same file, git's default merge handles them - accept the auto-resolution.
     c. If conflicts require judgment (overlapping changes to the same lines), spawn an Opus agent with both worktrees' diffs, the plan context for the affected workstreams, and instructions to resolve the conflict. The agent must explain its resolution choices in its response. If the resolution agent fails, escalate to the user rather than retrying - merge conflicts requiring human judgment are a reasonable escalation point.
     d. After all merges complete, run the full test suite to verify the integrated code works. If tests fail, treat as a verification failure (return to implement phase for the affected area).
   - After a wave's worktrees are merged and integrated verification passes in the main worktree, append that wave's task IDs to `completed_tasks` and update `.build/plans/{slug}-implementation-summary.md` with final integrated status. Store task IDs only, such as `T-001`; do not store checksums or commit IDs.
7. **Mid-review gate**: After all workstreams complete and merge (before verify), spawn a **Sonnet agent** for mid-review (Phase 3b). Pass it the plan, review, state, requirements, context, and implementation-summary paths plus a summary of what was built. For complex changes (state says `complexity: complex`), also run mid-reviews after each major workstream completes. When the agent returns, address any fixes needed. If it returns RETHINK, treat as a scope change — return to Phase 1 with rework notes.
8. Commit working chunks with clear messages as you go.
9. When all implementation is done and tests pass:
   - Update `.build/plans/{slug}-implementation-summary.md` with final implementation state, completed waves, completed task IDs, files changed, deviations from plan, blockers, and verification commands run during implementation
   - Update state to `phase: verify`
   - Append to history
   - **Auto-continue**: Proceed to Phase 3c (Verify).

---

## Phase 3b: Mid-Review (Sonnet agent)

**Trigger**: State says `phase: mid-review`, or spawned inline during Phase 3

1. Read the plan, review, requirements, context, implementation summary if present, and state (which notes what's done/remaining)
2. Review changes made so far against the plan
3. Run tests, check for issues
4. **Rethink check**: Given what was learned during implementation (surprises, unexpected complexity, assumptions that turned out wrong), is the plan still the right approach? If the remaining work would be better served by a revised plan, return RETHINK with reasons.
5. Update state:
   - Good: `phase: implement`, note what's done and what's remaining
   - Issues: `phase: implement`, add `fixes_needed:` field
   - Structural problems: return RETHINK with what changed and why the current plan no longer fits
6. Append to history

**Return to caller**: PROCEED (with optional fixes), or RETHINK (plan is no longer valid, describe what changed).

---

## Phase 3c: Verify

**Trigger**: State says `phase: verify`

1. Read `.build/plans/{slug}-state.md`, `{slug}-requirements.md`, `{slug}-plan.md`, and `{slug}-implementation-summary.md`
2. Invoke `/build:verify` via the Skill tool
3. Save the verification report to `.build/plans/{slug}-verify.md` before changing phase.
4. If **VERIFIED**: Update state to `phase: architect-review`. Auto-continue to Phase 4.
5. If **FAILED**: Update state back to `phase: implement` with `verification_failures:` field listing what failed. Address failures and re-verify.
6. If **PARTIAL** (some checks unavailable, artifacts missing, uncovered requirements, or missing `must_haves` evidence): Note what's unavailable. Proceed to Phase 4 - gaps are not hidden, and architect review must account for them.
7. Append to history

---

## Phase 4: Architect Review

**Trigger**: State says `phase: architect-review`

1. Read `.build/plans/{slug}-state.md`, `{slug}-requirements.md`, `{slug}-context.md`, `{slug}-plan.md`, `{slug}-review.md`, `{slug}-implementation-summary.md`, and `{slug}-verify.md`. Stop and report any missing artifact before reviewing.
2. Read the full diff since the workflow started. If `base_ref` exists in state, use `git diff {base_ref}...HEAD`; otherwise fall back to current diff behavior and report `base_ref unavailable`.
3. Invoke `/build:architect-review` via the Skill tool
4. Save the review to `.build/plans/{slug}-architect-review.md` before changing phase.
5. Update state:
   - **PASS** or **PASS_WITH_NOTES**: `phase: complete`
   - **FAIL**: `phase: implement`, add `architect_fixes:` field with specific issues
6. Append to history

After the agent returns:
- **Passed**: Continue to Phase 5 (Complete).
- **Issues**: Re-enter Phase 3 to fix the architect's findings, then re-verify.

---

## Phase 5: Complete

**Trigger**: State says `phase: complete`

1. Summarise: what was built, what was tested, key decisions made
2. Archive: move the `{slug}-*.md` files to `.build/plans/archive/[date]-{slug}/`
3. If the project has noodle, save a session digest

**Say**: "Workflow complete. [summary]"

---

## Auto-continue between phases

When a phase completes and the next phase needs a different model, **spawn an Agent** rather than asking the user to switch sessions:

```
Agent(
  model: "sonnet",   // or "opus" for implementation phases
  prompt: "Read .build/plans/{slug}-state.md and run the current phase of /build. [context summary]"
)
```

- **Sonnet** for: Review (Phase 2), Mid-Review (Phase 3b)
- **Opus** for: Plan (Phase 1), Implement (Phase 3), fixes after review
- Pass the agent a summary of relevant context and file paths so it can work autonomously
- Wait for the agent result and continue the workflow based on its output

**Never stop and ask the user to start a new session.** The build loop drives itself.

---

## Circuit breakers

- **Agent retry limit**: If an agent for the same workstream fails and is re-dispatched more than 2 times, stop retrying and escalate to the user. Log all failure reasons to the state file under `agent_failures:`. The problem is likely in the plan or the codebase, not a transient failure.
- **Phase loop limit**: If the workflow cycles back to the same phase more than 3 times (e.g., implement -> verify -> fail -> implement -> verify -> fail -> implement), halt the workflow and escalate. Log the full cycle history. The problem is systemic.
- **Scope change limit**: If SCOPE_CHANGE is reported more than twice in a single workflow, halt and escalate. The original feature description is likely underspecified - re-planning won't help without more input from the user.

When any circuit breaker fires, update the state file with `halted: true`, `halt_reason: [which breaker]`, and `halt_context: [summary of failures/changes]`. The user can resume by updating the state file after addressing the root cause.

---

## Rules

- **Always read state first.** Never assume which phase you're in.
- **Always update state last.** The state file is the source of truth across sessions.
- **Never stop to ask the user to switch sessions.** Use agents with model overrides instead.
- **Never skip phases.** The review exists for a reason. The verify gate exists for a reason.
- **Tests are mandatory.** Every phase that writes code must write or update tests. If tests don't pass at the end of your phase, you're not done.
- **Verify before architect review.** Phase 3c is not optional. No verification evidence = no architect review.
- **Handle agent statuses explicitly.** DONE, DONE_WITH_CONCERNS, NEEDS_CONTEXT, BLOCKED, SCOPE_CHANGE. Don't ignore concerns or work around blocks.
- **Use agents aggressively.** Parallel exploration, parallel implementation of independent pieces, background test runs, and phase transitions. Work like Claude Code works.
- **Commit often.** Small, working commits > one big commit at the end.
- **Keep history honest.** Every phase transition gets a timestamped entry. Include what happened, not just "phase changed".
- **Respect circuit breakers.** Retry limits exist to prevent runaway agents burning tokens on a broken approach. When a limit is hit, escalate to the user with full context of what failed and why - don't work around it or increase the limit.
